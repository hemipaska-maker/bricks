"""Smoke tests for the relocated bricks.playground.engine module.

After PR 2 of the playground redesign (#76) the engine moved from
``bricks.playground.showcase.engine`` to ``bricks.playground.engine``.
This file confirms the public ``BricksEngine`` and ``RawLLMEngine``
classes still expose the same shape that web routes + CLI rely on.
Heavyweight behavior is exercised by the existing integration tests
(``tests/integration/test_showcase_cached.py``); this file just locks
the import path and result shape.
